## KuroganeHammer.com Android App
KuroganeHammer.com Android app to view character frame data offline

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubendal.kuroganehammercom

### Update version for this branch
2.2

### Features
* View frame data without an Internet connection on your Android device (Smash 4/DBFZ)
* Favorite characters to put them on top of the list
* Manual sync with the KH API to get updates from the site
* Sm4sh Calculator (requires Internet connection when using it, uses Sm4sh Calculator API)
* Memes

### Notes
* Current Rivals of Aether/DBFZ pics are from KuroganeHammer.com, in case the app gets rejected by Google Play due to copyright policies they will be changed
* Rivals of Aether/DBFZ data isn't on KH API, it's scraped manually and added into the project's assets. So KH API sync won't change Rivals of Aether/DBFZ related data and updates are managed via app releases (until it gets added)
